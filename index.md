### CPSC 120


* Lab 6
  Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was the first time I worked with arguments. I had no idea that you can put information in before testing out the code by putting some sort of prompt like enter a number:. Exampling being that in this lab you can just insert information when you run the code. Ex: /sandwich turkey egg ketchup.
* Lab 7
  Lab 7 was the lab that introduced us on how to work with loops and and as well increasing our knowledge on how to make bigger and more demanding if statements. In this lab it involved us to tell the user what days he could park. That was part 2 of the lab and it was quite challenging as it involved a lot of code to be written down. Compared to the other labs, this one was the most demanding yet fun.
* Lab 12
  Lab 12 was the last lab we had and was the one that interested me the most as it involved using magick. In this lab it was the first time for us to create an image with colors and using a random generator to create a static color image. With this lab it gave me more knowledge on how to create images and maybe potentially using it to create a game later on in my studies.
